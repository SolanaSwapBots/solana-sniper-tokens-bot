**Solana Tokens Bot Pump.fun/Raydium** This advanced bot for the Solana network is designed to listen for and detect new liquidity pools on both Pump.Fun and Raydium, ensuring youâ€™re among the first to take action. It automatically purchases tokens using a fixed amount in WSOL, often executing transactions before the tokens are publicly available for exchange on the user interface.

The bot's success relies on RPC node speed, enabling high-priority and efficient operations in a competitive environment. After two months of intensive development and optimization, this program is now ready to assist Solana enthusiasts and traders in seizing the best token acquisition opportunities.

Even for testing purposes, it is essential to keep additional SOL available to cover transaction fees, in addition to using WSOL as the trading token. A recommended configuration is:

"1 SOL / 0.1 WSOL / QUOTE_AMOUNT=0.01"

This setup can be adjusted according to your needs and circumstances. Make sure to always have enough SOL in your wallet to ensure smooth execution of operations.
